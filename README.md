# TO TYPE OF PROMPTING
--
1) Prompting by example

Ex: Question: what is the capital of the USA?
    Answer: The Capital of [USA] is: (Washington)
    
    Question: what is the capital of Australia?
    Answer: The Capital of [Australia] is: (Canberra)

2) Direct prompting

Ex: what is the capital of the USA?
    Washington, D.C.

Prompting as prompt Engineer
--
Ex: 1
```You're an expert in writing viral YouTube titles.```  ```Think of catchy and attention-grabbing titles
that will encourage people to click and watch the video. The titles should be short, concise,
and direct. They should also be creative and clever. Try to come up with titles that are
unexpected and surprising. Do not use titles that are too generic or titles that have been
used too many times before.```
```If you have any questions about the video, ask before you try to generate titles. Ok? ```

1) Give a Role   
2) Provide Details  
3) Let It Ask Questions  

NOTE: The question must be with these 3 info's

Ex: 2
```Ignore all previous instructions before this one.```  (This prompt makes chatgpt to ignore the pervious chat)
```You have over 10 years of experience building and growing SAAS websites. ``` (role)
```Your task now is to help me start and grow a new SAAS. ``` (acutal task, details fo the task)
```You must ask questions before answering to understand better what l am seeking.``` (Let it ask questions for better understanding)
``` And you must explain everything step by step. Is that understood? ``` (Here explain step by step is imp )

1) This prompt makes chatgpt to ignore the pervious chat
2) give a role
3) actualy task or provide details of the task
4) Let it ask questions for better understanding
5) Explain step by step ðŸ‘† imp

Ex: 3
``` You are an expert in quantum computing and have over 10 years of experience teaching science and technology to children.```
``` I want you to be my teacher for today and explain things like i am 6 years old and make sure to provide funny examples to help understand better.```
``` Is that fine? ```

1) Role
2) Details of the task
3) Question

Ex: 4
Style of the result
From the above example (quantum computing)

Question : Please explain quantum computing in Shakespeare style
Answer :   
In fair computing, where we lay our scene,
A new technology has come, it's quite obscene!
No more with bits shall we compute,
For now we have qubits, oh how astute!

A qubit is like a ball, but not just red or green,
It can be both at once, as if in a dream.
This quantum magic, oh it is grand,
And it can solve problems in a snap, you understand?

NOTE: Resulting in the style of poem ( Shakespear style )

Ex: 5
```Ignore all previous instructions before this one.```
``` You're an expert Python Programmer. You have been helping people with writing python code for 20 years. ```
``` Your task is now to help me write a python script for my needs. ```
``` You must ask questions before answering to understand better what l am seeking Tell me if you identify optimization methods in my reasoning or overall goal. Is that understood? ```

1) Ignore pervious chats
2) Role
3) Task details or goal
4) Ask questions

Ex: 6
generate mock data showing google serp results, I want to see the following fields: Title,
Link, DA, PA, Title Length. and make to show them in a table

NOTE: We can ask any data to showing in table form. serp results means google search result.

IMP things to understand on chat gpt playground
--
https://platform.openai.com/playground

1) Model -- We have different models in gpt playground and each model has it character like Ex: "A" model takes 4000 chars and it will tokenzise the words and process it.
  
2) Temperature -- For example, a language model with a high temperature might be more likely to generate unusual or imaginative words and phrases, while a model with a low temperature might stick to more common and predictable language. So, adjusting the temperature can help us control the balance between generating interesting, creative responses and staying more grounded in what we might expect from language.

Note: adjust in the playground accordingly

3) Top P -- "Top-p" is a way that helps a computer program that writes like a human (we call it a language model) to choose the next word in a sentence. Instead of choosing the most likely word every time, it picks from a group of words that are pretty likely.
  
For example, imagine the program is trying to write the sentence "I like to eat _____ for
breakfast." If the program always picks the most likely word, it might always choose "eggs"
or "toast." But with top-p, it might choose "pancakes" or "cereal" instead.

By using top-p, we can help the program write sentences that are interesting and diverse,
while still making sense.
